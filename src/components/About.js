      Pepe the Frog (/ˈpɛpeɪ/) is a Internet meme consisting of a green
      anthropomorphic frog with a humanoid body. Pepe originated in a 2005 comic
      by Matt Furie called Boy's Club.[2] It became an Internet meme when its
      popularity steadily grew across Myspace, Gaia Online and 4chan in 2008. By
      2015, it had become one of the most popular memes used on 4chan and
      Tumblr.[3] Different types of Pepe include "Sad Frog", "Smug Frog", "Angry
      Pepe", "Feels Frog", and "You will never..." Frog. Since 2014, "Rare
      Pepes" have been posted on the "meme market" as if they were trading
      cards.[4][5][6] In the 2010s, the character's image was appropriated as a
      symbol of the alt-right movement, as well as by white supremacists.[7] The
      Anti-Defamation League included Pepe in its hate symbol database in 2016,
      but said most instances of Pepe were not used in a hate-related
      context.[8][9] Since then, Furie has expressed his dismay at Pepe being
      used as a hate symbol and has sued organizations for doing so.[7] In 2019,
      Pepe was used by protesters in the 2019–2020 Hong Kong protests. Despite
      being used in a political context, Pepe the Frog's use in Hong Kong is not
      perceived as being connected with alt-right ideology. Furie has welcomed
      the use of Pepe by Hong Kong protesters. Pepe remains a recognizable and
      familiar sight on social media platforms like 4Chan, Twitch, Reddit, and
      Discord, where images are modified into custom pepe-based emoji.
