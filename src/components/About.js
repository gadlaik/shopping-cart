      Pepe the Frog is a cartoon character that has become a popular Internet
      meme (often referred to as the "sad frog meme" by people unfamiliar with
      the name of the character). The character first appeared in 2005 in the
      on-line cartoon Boy's Club. In that appearance, the character also first
      used its catchphrase, "feels good, man." The Pepe the Frog character did
      not originally have racist or anti-Semitic connotations. Internet users
      appropriated the character and turned him into a meme, placing the frog in
      a variety of circumstances and saying many different things. Many
      variations of the meme became rather esoteric, resulting in the phenomenon
      of so-called "rare Pepes." The majority of uses of Pepe the Frog have
      been, and continue to be, non-bigoted. However, it was inevitable that, as
      the meme proliferated in on-line venues such as 4chan, 8chan, and Reddit,
      which have many users who delight in creating racist memes and imagery, a
      subset of Pepe memes would come into existence that centered on racist,
      anti-Semitic or other bigoted themes. In recent years, with the growth of
      the "alt right" segment of the white supremacist movement, a segment that
      draws some of its support from some of the above-mentioned Internet sites,
      the number of "alt right" Pepe memes has grown, a tendency exacerbated by
      the controversial and contentious 2016 presidential election. Though Pepe
      memes have many defenders, the use of racist and bigoted versions of Pepe
      memes seems to be increasing, not decreasing. However, because so many
      Pepe the Frog memes are not bigoted in nature, it is important to examine
      use of the meme only in context. The mere fact of posting a Pepe meme does
      not mean that someone is racist or white supremacist. However, if the meme
      itself is racist or anti-Semitic in nature, or if it appears in a context
      containing bigoted or offensive language or symbols, then it may have been
      used for hateful purposes.
